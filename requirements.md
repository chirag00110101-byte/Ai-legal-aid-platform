## 1. Introduction  
This document defines the scope, features, and acceptance criteria of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the AI-Driven Accessible Legal Aid Platform. The MVP aims to provide an accessible, multilingual, legally accurate platform to empower diverse users in India with effective legal information and aid. The focus is on simplicity, inclusivity, and compliance, laying a foundation for iterative enhancement.

## 3. Scope  

### 3.1 Included Features (MVP)  
- User authentication via mobile number or email with OTP delivered through SMS, WhatsApp, or email  
- Multilingual support for input and output, initially including Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, and Tamil  
- Simple, intuitive user interface configurable for accessibility needs such as text scaling, contrast adjustment, screen reader compatibility, and “read aloud” features  
- AI-backed query processing providing plain-language legal guidance aligned with Indian laws, constitution, and human rights principles  
- Secure user query history enabling users to track, retrieve, and continue previous interactions  
- Platform compliance with data privacy, security standards, and disclaimers explaining legal scope  

### 3.2 Out of Scope (Post-MVP / Future Phase)  
- KYC integration via Aadhaar or other government IDs  
- Bulk NGO dashboard for case management  
- Expansion to additional Indian languages and dialects  
- Advanced multi-modal AI interactions and knowledge graph integration  
- Detailed analytics and usage reporting dashboards

- AI models leverage vetted datasets specific to Indian legal contexts but will have limitations on complexity  
- Infrastructure will initially support limited concurrency, scalable in later phases  
- Legal domain experts will provide continuous content validation and updates
